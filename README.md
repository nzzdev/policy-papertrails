# Policy Papertrails

The NZZ Storytelling [EditorsLab](http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/programmes/editors-lab/sz-editors-lab/) project. Work in progress, powered by neurons, code and Bavarian beer. 

## The problem
* Too little reporting on policy making is done in a structured, data-informed way, but based on agenda setting, current events and anecdotal evidence. 
* We believe this is partly a mindset-problem, but also due to a lack of easy-to-use research tools.

## The project
* A searchable database of all public records from the Swiss parliament (that is word protocols, motions, petitions, votes, etc.).
* It allows you to see when, in what contexts and by whom certain issues have been brought up and how policy decisions have formed.
* It allows you to see patterns and outliers that make for stories of public interest. 

## Example queries / stories
* ███████████████████████████████████████████
